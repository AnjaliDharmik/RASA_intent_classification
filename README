### Project Description:
The aim of the project is to identify the intent of text.
### Data Description:
1.	train.csv
•	total number of rows: 15000
•	No missing data
•	2 features: text and intent

2.	test.csv
•	total number of rows: 4500
•	No missing data
•	1 feature: text

### Initial Findings:
1.	Data is equally distributed. 
2.	Total 150 intent are present in data.

### Model
1.	Preprocessing.ipynb : Convert text into Lowercase and remove Punctuation
2.	Model 1 - Intent Classification with RASA and Spacy Training: For Model Training and Evaluation
3.	Model 1 - Intent Classification with RASA and Spacy Prediction: Predict the results.
4.	RASA_intent_classification: saved model
5.	train_preprocessed.csv : cleaned data

### How to run the code
Required Packages:
•	! pip install rasa-nlu
•	! pip install sklearn_crfsuite
•	! pip install spacy
•	! python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
•	! pip install pandas

### Run the code:
Model 1 - Intent Classification with RASA and Spacy Prediction
1. Download and saved RASA_intent_classification folder
2. update the model_directory location where you saved RASA_intent_classification folder in the "Model 1 - Intent Classification with RASA and Spacy Prediction.ipynb" file on line number 6
e.g. model_directory = r'D:/RASA_intent_classification'
3. update input_text value on line number 16
input_text = '<provide text to predict intent>'
4. update Data Location
DATA_PATH = 'D:/'
5. Run the file 'Model 1 - Intent Classification with RASA and Spacy Prediction.ipynb'
6. Check the results 'predicted_results_RASA.csv' in DATA_PATH

### Conclusion
I have implemented and trained Model1 using RASA and Spacy and Model2 using BERT and TensorFlow. I got the better results with Model2 using RASA and Spacy.
